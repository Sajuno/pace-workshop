# Ten Million Row Challenge

I have generated a (CSV) dataset with ten million rows. Each row in the dataset
represents a single temperature measurement of a weather station. There are
multiple weatherstations in the dataset.

Example:

```csv
Sabirabad;11.6264
Cagnes-sur-Mer;-2.6981
Ekerö;-0.0331
Diabigué;1.6713
Pāiker;28.2705
Seddouk Oufella;25.7646
Kawashiri;35.8271
Bhānpura;16.1663
Colwood;-3.4679
Sabunçu;1.5455
Āvadi;8.3049
```

Your assignment, should you choose to accept it, is to aggregate all measurements,
and provide a minimum, average and maximum temperature for each station. Your program
should output only one single line of JSON per station on `stdout`, in the
following format:

```json
{ "station": "station name", "min": -12.3, "avg": 34.5, "max": 45.6 }
```

The station name must be exactly as it appears in the dataset, and all measurements
must have a significance of only _one single_ decimal.

Although the primary objective is to have a functionally working solution with correct
output, the secondary objective is to make it as fast as possible. Processing times
below one second should be easily achievable.

## Organisation

Pick any programming language and platform you like. Do it solo, as a pair or group.
We have 90 minutes to write code, after that each team will do a small (only 5 minutes!)
presentation with:

- demo of the solution
- conceptual overview of the solution (**no** in-depth code walk-throughs)
- what did your team find most challenging?

I would love pull requests which add a link to your solution's Github repo in this README,
in the list below:
